# cmu update

`cmu update` upgrades the globally installed CointMU CLI to the latest release published on the npm registry, or to a specific version you pin.

## Usage

```bash
cmu update [options]
```

## Options

| Flag              | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--to <version>`  | Install a specific published version instead of the latest.  |
| `-v, --verbose`   | Enable verbose logging for debugging.                        |

## Update Workflow

The command performs the following steps in order:

1. Reads the version of the currently installed CLI from its own `package.json`. If the file cannot be read, the current version is reported as `unknown`.
2. Queries the npm registry with `npm view cointmu-cli version` to resolve the target version. With `--to`, the spec becomes `cointmu-cli@<version>`.
3. Prints the current and target versions for comparison.
4. Exits without changes if the two are identical.
5. Otherwise runs `npm install -g cointmu-cli@<target>` and streams the installer output directly to the terminal.

## Pinning a Version

`--to` accepts an exact version, a semver range, or an npm dist-tag:

```bash
cmu update --to 1.3.2
cmu update --to ">=1.3.0"
cmu update --to latest
```

When a range matches several published versions, the highest match is selected and installed as an exact version.

If the requested version is not published, the command exits with:

```bash
Version "9.9.9" is not available on the npm registry for cointmu-cli.
```

::: warning
The `--to` value is validated before it reaches npm. Values containing shell metacharacters, or beginning with `-`, are rejected outright:

```bash
Invalid --to value "<value>". Expected a semver version, range, or npm dist-tag (e.g. "1.3.2", ">=1.3.0", "latest").
```

This is a defense-in-depth check. The command never invokes a shell — both the registry query and the install run through a direct process call with an explicit argument list.

## Output

When an update is available:

```bash
Checking the npm registry for the target version...
current version : 1.3.3
target version  : 1.3.4

Executing: npm install -g cointmu-cli@1.3.4

Update completed successfully!
```

When the installed version already matches the target:

```bash
Checking the npm registry for the target version...
current version : 1.3.4
target version  : 1.3.4

Already on the target version. Nothing to do.
```

If the registry is unreachable, the version is invalid, or the global install fails, the command prints an error message and exits with code `1`.

::: info
`cmu update` only manages installations made through npm. If the CLI was installed from source with `npm install -g .`, pull the repository and rebuild instead. See [Installation](/docs/cli/installation).
:::

## Verifying the Update

Confirm the new version after the install completes:

```bash
cmu version
```
